Project Instructions: SQL Analysis on a Schema 
Objective
The objective of this project is to perform SQL queries on a schema, demonstrating your understanding of SQL concepts and data analysis techniques. You will write and execute queries to extract meaningful insights from the data and present your findings.
Steps and Guidelines
1.	Set Up Your Environment
o	Ensure you have access to a SQL database (MySQL).
o	Download and set up a schema. 
2.	Project Setup
o	Create a new directory for your project.
o	Use a SQL script for your analysis.
o	Create a README file that briefly describes the dataset and the steps you plan to take in your analysis.
3.	Data Import and Schema Overview
o	Import the data into your SQL database.
o	Provide an overview of the schema with ER diagram.
o	Use DESCRIBE or SHOW COLUMNS commands to understand the structure of each table.
4.	Data Analysis Using SQL
o	Descriptive Statistics:
	Write queries to calculate basic statistics such as count, sum, average, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns.
	Example: Calculate the total sales, average order value, and total number of transactions.
o	Data Cleaning:
	Write queries to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
	Example: Find rows with NULL values in important columns and decide how to handle them (e.g., filling, removing).
o	Aggregation and Grouping:
	Use GROUP BY to aggregate data by different dimensions.
	Example: Calculate total sales by product category, region, or time period.
o	Joins and Relationships:
	Write queries to join tables to extract meaningful insights.
	Example: Join the sales with the product table to get product names and categories.
o	Subqueries and CTEs:
	Use subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to write complex queries.
	Example: Use a CTE to calculate the monthly sales and then find the month with the highest sales.
o	Advanced SQL Functions:
	Use window functions to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
	Example: Calculate running totals or moving averages.
5.	Insights and Conclusions
o	Summarize your key findings from the SQL analysis.
o	Discuss any patterns, anomalies, or interesting relationships you discovered.
o	Highlight any potential areas for further analysis or questions that emerged from your analysis.
6.	Documentation and Presentation
o	Ensure your SQL script is well-documented. Include comments to explain each query, the rationale behind your choices, and your findings.
o	Prepare a brief presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing your project. Include key findings, interesting queries, and potential next steps.
o	Submit your SQL script, the README file, and the presentation slides.
