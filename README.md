## Requirements
    - MYSQL Database Server
    - Client Workbench - MySQL WorkBench
    - Azure Databse Connection (to access online setup databse)
        Connection name: group3.mysql.database.azure.com
        Host: group3.mysql.database.azure.com
        port : 3306
        user : group3
        password : SQLgroup3project


## Getting Started

Follow these below steps to run the queries:

### 1. Download the schemas / data set.
    - Need to unzip the submitted 'SQL_Mini_Project', and store it into your preferred local directory.
        Unzipped directory contains the queries schema files and data set related csv files along with reference documents.
        Note : Instead, you may also download the data set CSV files from the kaggle link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data

### 2. Connect to the server
        Before opening the database connection, you would be required to edit the connection from settings:
        Goto advanced tab, append the setting on Others tab like: OPT_LOCAL_INFILE=1
    - Local database connection:
        To use the local database, by default you would be having your local server connection existing. You may utilize the same.
    - Azure database connection:
        : To use the azure online database, You may refer to the abive given Azure database server details and connect

        Azure Database Connection refers to the process of connecting applications to Azure's various database services, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure provides scalable, secure, and managed database solutions that are ideal for cloud applications.
            Key Components:
                Connection Strings: A connection string is a string used to establish a connection to a database. It contains necessary parameters like the server name, database name, user credentials, and more.
                Authentication: Azure supports various authentication methods, including SQL authentication (username and password) and Azure Active Directory authentication, which enhances security and allows for centralized user management.
                Firewall Rules: To enhance security, Azure databases come with built-in firewall rules that restrict access to specified IP addresses. Users must configure these rules to allow their applications to connect.
                Connection Pools: Azure databases support connection pooling, which helps improve performance by reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones for each database operation.
                Data Encryption: Azure provides features for data encryption both at rest and in transit to ensure data security.
                Benefits:
                Scalability: Easily scale your database resources based on application needs.
                Managed Services: Azure handles maintenance tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring.
                Global Availability: Access your databases from anywhere, with data replication options for high availability.

### 3. Load the schema files into the workbench
    - Open the database connection and Import the schema files into your workbench

### 4. Load the schema files into the workbench
    - Copy the location of the directory 'SQL_Mini_Project' (Make sure the path is pointing to csv files)
    - Open the file 'BikeStores-load_data', and replace all the text 'CSV_FILES_PATH' to copied path (eg- C:\\DATA\\VS_Code_Notes\\SQL_Mini_Project) Note- You may have to use single forward slash in case of mac

### 5. Run the queries:

    - Offline Execution: To run from your local/azure database server:
        Open the queries file 'file_to_run' and do run all

    - Online Execution: You may also utilize the app.hex platform to run the queries by connecting to Azure database.
        Hex is a collaborative data analysis platform designed to help teams explore, analyze, and visualize data seamlessly. It combines coding, documentation, and interactive data applications in one environment.

        Do run all to see the results


## Schema Overview

The **BikeStores** database contains information related to a bike store chain, including products, customers, orders, and staff. The primary tables in the schema are:

- **Stores**: Information about store locations.
- **Staffs**: Details of staff members and their roles.
- **Brands**: Brands of the products sold.
- **Categories**: Categories of the products.
- **Products**: Detailed product information.
- **Stocks**: Inventory levels of products in stores.
- **Customers**: Customer information.
- **Orders**: Orders placed by customers.
- **Order Items**: Details of products within each order.

### Data Cleaning

    - Identified rows with `NULL` values in important columns such as `phone` in the `customers` and `staffs` tables.
    - Found missing `shipped_date` entries in the `orders` table, which could affect shipping time analyses.
    - Decided to retain these entries.
