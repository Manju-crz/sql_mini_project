    - Azure Databse Connection (to access online setup databse)
        Connection name: group3.mysql.database.azure.com
        Host: group3.mysql.database.azure.com
        port : 3306
        user : group3
        password : SQLgroup3project


## Getting Started

Follow these below steps to run the queries:

### 1. Download the schemas / data set.
    - Need to unzip the submitted 'SQL_Mini_Project', and store it into your preferred local directory.
        Unzipped directory contains the queries schema files and data set related csv files along with reference documents.
        Note : Instead, you may also download the data set CSV files from the kaggle link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data
    - Currently we have the data from 2016 to 2018 in this data set

### 2. Connect to the server
        Before opening the database connection, you would be required to edit the connection from settings:
        Goto advanced tab, append the setting on Others tab like: OPT_LOCAL_INFILE=1
    - Local database connection:
        To use the local database, by default you would be having your local server connection existing. You may utilize the same.
    - Azure database connection:
        : To use the azure online database, You may refer to the abive given Azure database server details and connect

        Azure Database Connection refers to the process of connecting applications to Azure's various database services, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure provides scalable, secure, and managed database solutions that are ideal for cloud applications.
            Key Components:
                Connection Strings: A connection string is a string used to establish a connection to a database. It contains necessary parameters like the server name, database name, user credentials, and more.
                Authentication: Azure supports various authentication methods, including SQL authentication (username and password) and Azure Active Directory authentication, which enhances security and allows for centralized user management.
                Firewall Rules: To enhance security, Azure databases come with built-in firewall rules that restrict access to specified IP addresses. Users must configure these rules to allow their applications to connect.
                Connection Pools: Azure databases support connection pooling, which helps improve performance by reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones for each database operation.
                Data Encryption: Azure provides features for data encryption both at rest and in transit to ensure data security.
                Benefits:
                Scalability: Easily scale your database resources based on application needs.
                Managed Services: Azure handles maintenance tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring.

	- Advanced SQL Functions:
        - Advanced SQL functions used in many below analysis like:
        - Top selling products and least selling products
        - On which product we have the most profit as a store
        -  Segment products into quartiles based on total sales
        - Date related functions used to summaries sales based on months and years etc, and customer order analysis.
        - Also in analysing the delays in the order fulfillments
        - In order to Predict future sales using LEAD()
            and many more queries have similar window functions alltogether.
		- OVER: keyword is used in conjunction with window functions. It defines a window or a set of rows that the function should operate on, allowing you to perform calculations across a specified range of rows related to the current row
        - The NTILE: function in SQL is a window function that divides a result set into a specified number of roughly equal parts, or "tiles." It assigns a bucket number (from 1 to the number of tiles specified) to each row based on the order of the rows in the partition.
        - The YEAR: function in SQL is used to extract the year from a date or datetime value. It returns the year as a four-digit integer, which can be useful for filtering, grouping, or performing calculations based on the year.
        - The MONTHNAME: function in SQL is used to retrieve the name of the month from a date or datetime value. It returns the full name of the month as a string, which can be useful for reporting, formatting dates, or grouping results based on month names.
        - The LEAD: function in SQL is a window function that provides access to the subsequent row in a result set without the need for a self-join. It allows you to retrieve data from a following row based on a specified order, making it useful for various analytical tasks, such as calculating differences between rows or comparing values
        - The COALESCE: function in SQL is used to return the first non-null value from a list of arguments. It's particularly useful for handling NULL values in your data, allowing you to provide default values or perform conditional logic.
